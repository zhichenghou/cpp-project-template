# A general cpp project template

**This folder tree defines the project's structure.** 

1. bin: the output executables go here, both for the app and for tests, and removed on a clean
2. build: all objects go here, and removed on a clean
3. doc: all documents
4. include: all header files, both this project's and necessary third party's 
5. lib: all lib files, both get compiled by this project and other
6. src: all source file and test file of this app, there is a simple rule for the test files, the file XXX_test.cpp is the test file for XXX.cpp, this rule simplifies the Makefile for test.

**The _gitigonre file defines ignore rules for git, you need rename it to .gitignore to use it.**

**The Makefile defines some rule to make make easier.**

1. all: the default rule, will generate all objects that are generated by ths source (not contains test) file in src folder
2. bin: link all objects to an executable, it's name is defined by the variable TARGET
3. test: generate all test executables and execute them, test executables are generated by the all test files (end with _test.cpp) in src folder
4. main: a quick unit test rule, need edit for a specific test when use
5. clean: clean build and bin dir

**A general process to develop.**

1. edit header file in src dir (for this app use) or include dir (for other use), like XXX.h
2. edit src file in src dir, like XXX.cpp
3. edit test src file in src dir, like XXX_test.cpp
4. make and debug

*Note: some sample code already exist to make this easier to understand, you shoud delete them in your own project.*
